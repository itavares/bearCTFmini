## Steganography

### STEG1 - file: `justanormalpicture.png`

Sometimes, pictures like to express themselves... but how do they talk?
In programming, you know, we communicate through strings. Can pictures do the same? 

### STEG2 - file : `steg.txt`
So many file types, hope I saved my file correctly.

### STEG3 - file : `stegsolve.jpg`
Images in Images, can you find my secret message.


## General

### files: `Thing1.txt` , `Thing2.txt`
We know Thing1 and Thing2 look about the same
But deep inside they are different
They are both insane.



## Forensics
### Forensics1 - file : `whitepages.txt`
I stopped using YellowPages and moved onto WhitePages... but the page they gave me is all blank!

### Forensics2
For this challenge, you need to connect to our little server. The file will be in there :
### ` ssh bear@34.201.166.179 ` | password: bearCTF
### Directory: Forensics | file: `haha.txt`
Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.



## Exploitation
For these challenges, you need to connect to our little server. The file will be in there :
### ` ssh bear@34.201.166.179 ` | password: bearCTF


### EX1 Directory: Exploitation/EX1 | file: `vuln`
Can you tell me how many bytes it takes to crash the program?

### EX2 Directory: Exploitation/EX2 | file: `store`
Can you buy the flag from the store?
